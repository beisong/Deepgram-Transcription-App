## Frontend (dg-frontend)

The frontend is a React-based web application that allows users to:

-   Upload audio files for transcription.
-   Record audio and send it for transcription.
-   Stream live audio for real-time transcription.


## Backend (dg-backend)

## Postman Collection (postman collection)

A Postman collection is available to test the Deepgram’s API endpoints.
